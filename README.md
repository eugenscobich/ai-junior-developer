# AI Junior Developer

## Project Description
The AI Junior Developer is a backend application designed to serve as a customizable ChatGPT, capable of assisting in software development tasks. Its main objectives are to automate routine coding tasks, provide intelligent code suggestions, and integrate seamlessly with existing developer tools and APIs. The application leverages OpenAI's language processing capabilities to understand development requirements and efficiently guide users through complex software engineering challenges.

## Key Features
- **Automated Code Generation:** Develop code structures and logic based on user inputs.
- **Tool Integration:** Connect with various development tools such as version control, build systems, and deployment pipelines.
- **Interactive Assistant:** Engage in detailed conversations to explain programming concepts and provide coding recommendations.
- **Customizable Configurations:** Fine-tuned settings to align the AI with specific project needs and team workflows.

This project makes it easier for developers to boost productivity, maintain consistency in coding styles, and reduce the manual effort required in codebase management.
